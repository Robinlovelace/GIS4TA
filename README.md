# GIS4TA

Repository to support the 'GIS for Transport Applications' (GIS4TA) workshop

## Key information

The aim of [GIS4TA](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/GIS4TA) is to provide a forum for learning, discussion and
dissemination for people using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for
transport planning and related applications.

The first [#GIS4TA](https://twitter.com/hashtag/gis4ta?src=hash) 
(tweet the hashtag!) takes place in Leeds in April 2015. More details
here: http://leeds.gisruk.org/gis4ta.html

The main purpose of this repository is to link together resources that
were used for the workshop, to ensure that the materials will be of
use to others. Hopefully this set of links and resources will continue
to grow. Feel free to fork, clone, copy and re-use any of the content.

But please credit the source.
