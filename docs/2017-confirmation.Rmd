Dear GIS4TA Attendees,

On Thursday next week we'll start the second GIS for Transport Applications workshop (GIS4TA).
Note in terms of arrival, it is being held this year at the Leeds Institute for Data Analytics (LIDA) and will commence at 10:00 prompt on Thursday 16th.
It will run until 16:30 on Friday 17th of November. 
If you have any issues attending the whole event please let me know at r.lovelace@leeds.ac.uk

For directions to **Level 11, the Worseley Building**, see http://lida.leeds.ac.uk/about-lida/contact/

For a full agenda see https://github.com/Robinlovelace/GIS4TA/blob/master/docs/2017-workshop-application.Rmd

## Preparing for the workshop

In terms of preparation, please ensure you have a **laptop** with the necessary software for the tutorials installed including an *updated version of R* with ability to install packages, QGIS and a recent version of Java (JRE 8).

We assume you already have some packages already, which can be installed as follows:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c("osmdata", "stplanr", "sf", "dodgr", "jsonlite", "tidyverse", "mapview"))
```

To check your set-up is working, try executing the commands below in R.
If you get a result like the one [here](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/GIS4TA/blob/master/figures/leeds-map.png?raw=true), your set-up is good.
Note: this results could help you navigate here, from Leeds rail station to the Worsley building:

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(sf)
library(osmdata)
library(tidyverse)
library(stplanr)
library(dodgr)
# geo_code("worsley building")
# geo_code("new station street leeds")
r = viaroute(startlng = -1.54735, startlat = 53.7961, endlng = -1.555641, endlat = 53.803290)
r = viaroute2sldf(r)
destination = opq("leeds uk") %>% add_osm_feature("name", "Worsley Building") %>% osmdata_sf()
m = mapview::mapview(r) +
  mapview::mapview(destination$osm_polygons)
# mapview::mapshot(m, file = "leeds-map.png")
```

The workshop will be a mixture of demonstrations, challenges, and opportunities to discuss your own research. We hope the event will offer a place for likeminded researchers to form new professional relationships and open up doors for future research collaborations.

Robin Lovelace, Mark Padgham and Craig Morton (the GIS4TA 2017 organisers)

   We hope that you have a safe journey to the workshop and look forward to welcoming you to LIDA.

    

    Sincerely,

     

     The GIS4TA Team.
