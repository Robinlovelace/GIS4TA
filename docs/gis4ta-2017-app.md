# GIS for Transport Applications (GIS4TA)

# Overview

 This conference started as a 1 day workshop that preceded the GISRUK 2015 conference. This was an overwhelming success. At the GISRUK 2017 conference in Manchester, it was agreed that there should be a full 2 day conference on the topic.

We expect it to be a relatively small (~30 people) but high impact conference at the cutting edge of geographical data analysis for transport policy.

# Aim and objectives

 The aim is to share knowledge, skills and ideas around the application of geospatial data to address urgent transport and urban planning problems.
By the end of the workshop, all participants should be better answer many questions in this area, including:

- What is the 'landscape' of tools and software projects in the space of GIS4TA?
- How to effectively handle large transport datasets?
- Where to locate new transport infrastructure? 
- How to develop automated and reproducible transport planning workflows?
- How can increasingly available datasets on air quality, traffic and active travel be used to inform policy?
- How to visualise results in an attractive and potentially on-line and interactive manner?
- How can geospatial methods be used to create local evidence bases needed to transition away from fossil fuels in the transport sector?
